Project Title: vprofile project 

Project Description:
In this project, I have implimented Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes (K8s). This pipeline allowed for the seamless and automated deployment of application code to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Kops VMs.

Project Highlights:

Continuous Integration with Jenkins: Set up Jenkins as the CI server for the project. Jenkins was configured to automatically build the application whenever code changes were pushed to the version control system.

Maven Integration: Integrated Maven to manage the project's build and dependencies. This allowed for consistent and repeatable builds.
SonarQube Integration: Implemented SonarQube for code quality analysis. The pipeline was configured to run static code analysis to identify and address code quality issues.

Docker Registry: Utilized a Docker registry to store Docker images. Images were built during the CI process and pushed to the registry for deployment.

Helm Charts: Created Helm charts to define the application's deployment configuration. Helm charts provide a templated way to manage Kubernetes manifests, making it easier to manage complex applications.

Kubernetes (K8s) Deployment: Deployed the application to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. This allowed for efficient scaling, management, and orchestration of application containers.

Jenkins Master and Kops VM: To optimize resource utilization, the Jenkins master server and Kops VM were hosted on the same virtual machine. This setup ensured that the CI/CD pipeline was efficiently managed without consuming excess resources.
Responsibilities:

Configured Jenkins pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
Integrated Maven for dependency management and build automation.
Set up SonarQube for code quality analysis and ensured that the pipeline checks for code quality issues.
Managed Docker images and ensured they were pushed to the Docker registry.
Created Helm charts to define deployment configurations and simplify the Kubernetes deployment process.
Oversaw the deployment of the application to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Kops VM.
Managed the Jenkins master and Kops VM on the same server for resource efficiency.
Technologies Used:

Jenkins
Maven
SonarQube
Docker
Helm
Kubernetes (K8s)
Kops

Outcome:
The project successfully established a robust CI/CD pipeline, integrating Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes. This allowed for rapid development and deployment, code quality checks, and efficient resource management. The project improved development workflow, reduced manual intervention, and ensured the availability of consistently deployed applications.

This project serves as an excellent example of my proficiency in setting up and managing complex CI/CD pipelines and integrating a variety of tools to facilitate streamlined software development and deployment processes.
